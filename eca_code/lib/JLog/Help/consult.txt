The Consult pane provides the facilities for consulting Prolog source code and for reseting the internal database (the Knowledge Base) to its original state.To begin, enter the source code for your program into the Source text area.  You may do this either by typing, or by pasting text from another editor, provided your Java environment supports this. You can also specify the text to appear in this text area by using the "source" parameter within the <applet> HTML tag.  See the Applet Parameters section for more information about this parameter tag.To consult the code in the Source text area, press the Consult button at the lower right of the text area.  Predicates derived from the consult are added to the database by overwriting.  This means that predicates from previous consults are preserved providing there are no new predicates defined with the same name and arity.  The upshot is that all predicates of the same name and arity should be defined in one place so that they are evaluated during the same consult operation.To reset the database (the Knowledge Base) to its original state, removing all user defined predicates, click on the Reset KB button.Error and consult status messages appear in the Status text area. When syntax errors occur, the offending code is highlighted in the Source text area.Database changes are not permitted during query operations, but you can edit your source code.  The Reset KB and Consult buttons are not available during queries, but are enabled when queries complete or are aborted.  See the Query Facilities section for more information on completing or aborting queries.
