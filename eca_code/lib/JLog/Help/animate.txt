The Animate pane provides a graphical viewing region for animations.  This visible portion of the graphical area depends on how large the JLog window is.  Scroll bars appear if the animation canvas is larger than the display area.The animation engine responsible for drawing the graphics is available through the animate/2 predicates detailed in the Animate Predicates section.
