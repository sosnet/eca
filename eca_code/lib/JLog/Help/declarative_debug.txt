To perform declarative debugging you need to know how a predicate was proved.  To do this in JLog, turn debugging on and enter your query.  When the query succeeds, click on the Proved tab to reveal the Proved pane.  Select the query predicate instance and click the display button.  Information about that predicate instance is revealed, including those sub goals which must be proved if the predicate instance is proved.  The numbering, in square brackets, includes either the letter 'p' if the instance or sub goal is on the 'proved' stack, and 'g' if it is still on the goal stack.  If the query has succeeded then every predicate instance on the 'proved' stack is indeed proved.If you believe that one of the sub goals should not be true, then find the predicate instance for that sub goal in the appropriate list, using the number provided, and display the information for that instance.  Repeat this procedure until you have found your problem.You can also perform similar operations even before the query is proved; however, in this case some of the sub goals may still be on the goals stack, awaiting evaluation.For more information on debugging, see the Debug Facilities section.
